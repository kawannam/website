description: Programming competitions impose a set of challenging coding tasks to teams of up to three contestants. Solutions to these problems must meet strict time and space restrictions, and require advanced programming techniques and quick analysis. Each team must develop their solutions using a single computer without access to the internet. Over the last few years I have competed at the city, provincial, and regional levels.
