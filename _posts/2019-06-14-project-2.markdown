description: Our work explores the use of embroidery as a medium for personal data representation. Personal physicalization is at the intersection of personal visualization and physicalization. More precisely, personal physicalization uses tangible objects to represent data in a personal context. This unique design space inspired us to explore alternative mediums to integrate data with personal artifacts, as well as facilitate the exploration of a multi-sensory data encoding. We first developed a workflow for authoring embroidered physicalizations. Then, we used this process to create an embroidered blanket based on text message data.

More specifically, I developed a python library that allows low level control over texture when authoring visualization using a (computer numerically controlled) embroidery machine. Using the library I embroidered a comforter with a visualization of text messages exchanged between me and my partner. The blanket is covered in colourful lines, which each represent a single text message. The length of each line represents the length of the message, with my messages extending to the right and his to the left. Each line is composed of several colours representing IBM Watson's emotional analysis of the message. Finally, each conversation was tagged with key words, which were embroidered next to their respective conversations. 

This project aimed to design mementos using personal data and investigate techniques for embedding our stories into the artifacts we cherish. It was presented as a poster at VIS 2019 and received an honourable mention for best poster.
