description: I filled a technical support role at Hitachi, where I assisted IT technicians with systems installations and problems as they arose, along with several smaller internal developer tools. The role was a four month internship designed to familiarize potential employees for the Solution Architect role. Following my internship, my direct manager described me as one of the most impressive students he had ever worked with (for the full recommendation see my LinkedIn page: www.linkedin.com/in/kendra-wannamaker-88622aa4).
